# CS 7150 Programming Assignment 0: Crash Course into Numpy

# Setup
1. Install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). It doesn't matter whether you use Python 2 or 3 because we will create our own environment that uses python3 anyways.
2. Create a conda environment using the appropriate command. On Windows, open the installed "Conda prompt" to run the command. On MacOS and Linux, you can just use a terminal window to run the command: `conda env create -f pa0_env.yml`
3. This will create an environment named 'cs7150_pa0'. Activate it using the Windows command, `activate cs7150_pa0` or the MacOS / Linux command, `conda activate cs7150_pa0` or `source activate cs7150_pa0`
4. Run the notebook using `jupyter notebook ./pa0_code/pa0.ipynb` and finish tasks described over there.
5. Since this is a mock programming assignment, you do not need to submit your finished Jupyter notebook file to Canvas.
